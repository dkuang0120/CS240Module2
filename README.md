# Overview
Final Project for CS240 (Computer Organization)

CATS is a custom Assembly language instruction set designed for MARS simulator.
It contains 11 renamed instructions and 10 custom instructions not already in MARS. 

# How to Run CATS
  1. In order to use this custom cat-themed Assembly language, make sure to have MARS-LE installed.
  2. Place the CATS.jar and CATS.java file into the customlang folder.
  3. Should you want to make changes to CATS.java, you can recompile CATS.java by typing 'javac -jar BuildCustomLang.jar CATS' into a terminal window.
     (Be sure that the directory is set to the MARS-LE folder.)
  4. In the MARS application, switch the language to CATSAssembly by going to Tools -> Language Switcher
